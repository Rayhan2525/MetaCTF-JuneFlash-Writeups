<p>This is a Flash CTF conducted by <a href="https://metactf.com/blog/">MetaCTF</a> on June 21st, 2024. Its a quick CTF format with 5 challenges: Binary Exploitation, Cryptography, Forensics, Reverse Engineering, and Web Exploitation. Time alotted for this competion was 2 hours</p>
<p>Good thing about a flash CTF, its a quick one. You get a short amount of time to solve challenges. These test your ability to solve challenges as quickly as possible. According to me it is a good way to start your CTF journey, because you can solve handfull amount of challenges and view writeups instantly, unlike traditional CTF, which lasts for few days and then writeups are published. Flash ctf is a quick and easy way to get a taste of what CTF's are like.</p>
